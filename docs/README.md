# OctoAcme Project Management Docs

This README provides an overview of the project management processes and serves as a guide to OctoAcme's core documentation.

## Project Management Overview

OctoAcme's project management approach emphasizes customer-first principles, iterative delivery, and transparent collaboration. Projects progress through phases: Initiation, Planning, Execution, Release, and Retrospective, each with specific checklists and deliverables—such as project charters, milestone roadmaps, risk registers, and well-defined acceptance criteria. Roles include Project Manager (scheduling, risk, reporting), Product Manager (vision, priorities, outcomes), Project Sponsor (strategic direction, funding, executive support), Developers (feature delivery, code review, test coverage), QA (validation), Quality Assurance Lead (process standards, quality gates, continuous improvement), Change Control Lead (change management, scope control), Communications Coordinator (stakeholder communication, information distribution), and Stakeholders (alignment, approvals). Communication strategies involve weekly and daily syncs, documented status reports, and clear escalation paths. Quality assurance involves automated and manual testing, incident playbooks, and continuous process improvement through retrospectives and success metric dashboards.
